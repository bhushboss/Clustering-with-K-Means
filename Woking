Feature Selection and Scaling
After loading the data, selected the 'Annual Income (k$)' and 'Spending Score (1-100)' columns for clustering.
These features were then scaled using StandardScaler to ensure the K-Means algorithm (which is distance-based) would treat both features equally.
 Elbow Method for Optimal k
 use the Elbow Method to find the optimal number of clusters (k). 
By plotting the inertia (within-cluster sum of squares) for k values from 1 to 10, we can see a distinct "elbow" at k=5.
This point represents a good balance between minimizing the inertia and avoiding an excessive number of clusters.
Elbow Method Plot
The plot clearly shows the "elbow" at k=5, after which the decrease in inertia becomes much less significant.
 K-Means Fitting and Cluster Visualization
Using the optimal value of k=5, I fitted the K-Means model to the data. 
The resulting clusters group the customers into five distinct segments.
Customer Segments Visualization
This scatter plot shows the five clusters. Each cluster represents a different customer profile:
Cluster 0 (Blue): Average income, average spending.
Cluster 1 (Orange): High income, low spending (Careful/Savers).
Cluster 2 (Green): Low income, low spending (Cautious).
Cluster 3 (Red): Low income, high spending (Target/Careless).
Cluster 4 (Purple): High income, high spending (Ideal Target).
 Clustering Evaluation
To mathematically evaluate the quality of the clusters, I used the Silhouette Score.
The Silhouette Score for k=5 is 0.5547. This score is between -1 and 1. 
A score of 0.5547 indicates that the clusters are reasonably dense and well-separated from each other, confirming a good clustering result.
A new file containing the original data along with the assigned cluster label for each customer has been saved.
